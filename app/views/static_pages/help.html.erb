<h2>What is Pinboard?</h2>
<p><a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> is an excellent
bookmarking service and personal archive for just about anything
you find online. It offers a ton of useful features and it's designed
to keep your data safe and open for the long term. It is absolutely worth 
<a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/">$10.07</a>.
Pushpin adds shared items and comments inspired by the late, great 
Google Reader.

<h2>How do I share a link to Pushpin?</h2>
<p>All the <a href="https://pinboard.in/howto/#privacy">public bookmarks</a>
you save to Pinboard are automatically imported to Pushpin, so you can use
any tool that posts to Pinboard. There are lots of 
<a href="https://pinboard.in/howto/#saving">bookmarklets</a>,
<a href="https://pinboard.in/resources/">browser extensions</a>, and 
<a href="https://pinboard.in/resources/">third-party tools</a> available.</p>
<p>My favorites are <a href="http://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, 
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pindroid/">Pindroid</a>,
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pinboard-tools/dpaohcncbmkojcpcjaojcehdlnjfbjkl?hl=en">Pinboard for Chrome</a>, and

<h2>How do I add a comment to a link I share?</h2>
<p>If you save a link to pinboard with a description,
it's automatically added to your link as a comment.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
<h2>What happens if I share a link in my feed?</h2>
<p>Clicking "share" underneath a link in your feed
saves it to your Pinboard account as a public bookmark.
It should show up in your Pushpin feed and shared items
right away.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
<h2>What happens if I save a link in my feed?</h2>
<p>Clicking "save" underneath a link in your feed saves
it to your Pinboard account as a private bookmark.
It will never show up in your Pushpin feed unless you
change its privacy setting on Pinboard.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
<h2>How can I change my avatar?</h2>
<p>Pushpin uses your <a href="https://secure.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>â€”
a universal profile image associated with your email. 
If you don't have one, you can sign up
<a href="https://secure.gravatar.com/site/signup/">here</a>.
You can change your Gravatar from your Pushpin 
<% if current_user %>
    <%= link_to "settings", edit_user_path(current_user) %>
    page.
<% else %>
settings page.
<% end %></p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
<h2>Where is my API token?</h2>
<p>You can find your API token on your <a href="https://pinboard.in/settings/">
    Pinboard settings</a> page.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
<h2>Are all my shared items and comments public?</h2>
<p>Yes, for now. Groups are one of many features I hope to
include eventually.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
<h2>Do I have to use my real name?</h2>
<p>No, but you do have to use <em>a</em> name.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
<h2>Is all my Pushpin data safe forever?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not. This is a very early prototype and anything 
   may break at any time.</p>
