# Pushpin

Pushpin adds comments and a "shared items" feed to your
public [Pinboard][pinboard] bookmarks, just like 
the late, great Google Reader [sharing][greader] feature.
It's a work in progress, but I'll have a public prototype up soon.

It's written in Ruby 2.0.0/Rails 4, and all my code is under
an [MIT license][mit]. I got started with Michael Hartl's Rails [tutorial][hartl],
which is available under the same terms.
