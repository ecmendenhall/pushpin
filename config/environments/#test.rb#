  Dates:
    -What are your preferences? I'm ready to start as soon as I can find
an apartment.
-Is there any timing strategy to think about? Do leasesend on a
particular day of the month in IL/Chicago?
-I'm planning to attend a close friend's wedding on Friday, July 5.
This is the only immobile event on my calendar in the next six months,
and I should only need to miss that Friday (since it's between 4th of
  July and a weekend). I don't know how time off works for apprentices,
but I want to get this cleared right away because it's really important.

  Relocation:
  -I know you mentioned you're a suburbanite now, but is there anywhere
you'd live if you were on an apprentice's budget? I'll probablylook
for a 2-3 monthsublet to start.
    -It looked likethe Purple, Red, and Blue linescame closest tothe
  office. Is thisright?
  -What risks regarding moving long distance am I probably
  underestimating now? Anything you wished you had thought about
  before you relocated?

  Other:
    -A family friend wants to hire me for some basic web design stuff. Is
                                        there an 8th Light policy on freelance work? I don't plan on making
this a habit (and I have no illusions that I'll have the time!), but
this was already in the works. If it's not okay to get paid, I'm
probably willing to do it for free. If it's not okay at all, I'd
                            definitely like to know.
